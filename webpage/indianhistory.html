        <h2>Indus Valley Civilization</h2>
        <p>
            The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, was one of the world's oldest urban civilizations, thriving around 2500 BCE to 1900 BCE in the Indus River basin.
            It was characterized by well-planned cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, advanced drainage systems, standardized weights and measures, and sophisticated artwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            The civilization had a robust economy based on agriculture and trade, with evidence of long-distance trade links with Mesopotamia and Egypt.
            The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization is still debated among historians, with possible causes including environmental changes, natural disasters, and invasions.

        <h2>British Raj</h2>
        <p>
            The British Raj refers to British rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
            It had a profound impact on Indian society, economy, and culture, leading to significant social and political changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The British implemented various policies, including the introduction of railways, telegraph systems, and English education, which transformed India's infrastructure and administrative framework.
            However, British rule also led to economic exploitation, social divisions, and nationalist movements, eventually culminating in India's independence in 1947.
