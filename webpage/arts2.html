            <h2>Dance</h2>
            <p>Bharatanatyam is a dance of Tamil Nadu in southern India. It traces its origins back to the Natyashastra,
                an ancient treatise on theatre written by the mythic priest Bharata. Originally a temple dance for
                women, bharatanatyam often is used to express Hindu religious stories and devotions.</p>
